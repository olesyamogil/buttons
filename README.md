## Building instructions

Button folder contains all files needed to use my Button component.
It may be imported into any project and used with these props:
* size (small, medium, large)
* color (default, success, warning, error)
* status (active, disabled, loading)
* action - a callback function, which is called on Button click
* link - an alternative to action, when the Button is supposed to be an anchor
